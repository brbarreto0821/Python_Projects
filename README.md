## General info
These are some Python projects and activities that I made while learning Python from a book by Connor P. Milliken. These are 
small projects that show what I have learned throughout the book.
	
## Technologies
Each project was created with Python version 3.7.6

## Features
#### FastFoodRestaurant_dataset.py
* It outputs the entire data set about fast food restaurants in the United States.

#### bargraph.py
* Allows the user to give a score to a movie and then asks if another user wants to give a score
* Outputs a bargraph when all users gives a score.
* The bargraph shows how many people gave a specific score from 0 through 5.

#### blackjack.py
* Play a game of blackjack with a dealer

#### calculator.py
* Lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers
* When subtracting or dividing, the program asks you if you want to reverse the number order if the second number is larger than the first

#### date_converter.py
* Input a date in US format and outputs a date in EU format
* Can input in MM/DD/YYYY format or (Month Day, Year) format

#### guessing_game.py
* Play a game where you try to guess the right number
* The game tells you if the number guessed was high or low

#### hangman_game.py
* Play a game of hangman
* Offers easy words to guess
* You can either guess a letter or type the whole word in

#### lineplot.py
* Outputs a lineplot with random data every time it is run
* Lineplot shows three different lines with different colors and design

#### nfl_stadium_webscraper.py
* Outputs how many NFL Stadiums there are in the United States and lists all of them

#### receipt.py
* Prints out a receipt created with print functions

#### security.py
* Prints out a string that has x's (floor), G's (guards), T (thief), and $ (money)
* If a T is next to $ without any G in between them, then the program prints out 'ALARM'
* If a G is between a T and $, then the program prints out 'quiet' 

#### shopping_cart.py
* Allows the user to select which item they want in their cart
* It allows the user to remove items from the cart or clear the whole cart

#### user_database_csv.py
* Allows the user to register which creates a .csv file with the information that the user entered
* The user may log in with the information that they entered and have an option to quit or logout

#### website_analysis.py
* Lets the user type in a website
* A bargraph is outputted with the most used words from the website

#### word_count_webscrape.py
* Allows the user to input a website
* Outputs the amount of words there are in the body of the website that was inputted

## Setup
To run these projects, you must have Python 3 (I used Python 3.7.6) or an app that can run .py files.
If you are using the command line enter this:

```
$ cd ../Python_Projects
$ python calculator.py (or any other file)
```

## Sources
Some of these projects were made from a book called _Python Projects for Beginners - A Ten-Week Bootcamp Approach to Python Programming_ by Connor P. Milliken. Thanks to this amazing book, I now have a clear understanding of programming in general.
